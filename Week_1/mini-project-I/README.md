# mini-project-I

This is the first mini-project of the bootcamp. In this project, I explore different API services. There are 2 parts to this project: 

1. Transport of London

2. Movies

## [Transport of London](\Week_1\mini-project-I\mini-project-I.ipynb)

During this mini-project, we will work with the API from [Transport of London](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). The main goal of this project is to practice different HTTP requests and extracting values from complex lists and nested dictionaries.


> #### Instruction
> Once you have your credentials ready, go to the file `mini-project-I.ipynb` and follow the instruction in there.


## [Movies](\Week_1\mini-project-I\mini-project-I-part-II.ipynb)

> #### Instruction
> Register for the [API service](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) to obtain the **API Key**. We will have to append this value as parameter `api_key` into each URL when sending the request.

Once we are registered we can check the documentation of this API [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/account).

In this part of the project, we will look for information about our favorite movie and actors. We will learn something about each other tomorrow when we present results.
