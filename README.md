# Kyle's Notes

This repository contains all of the notes taken by [Kyle Kulas](https://github.com/KyleKulas) for the [Lighthouse Labs](http://www.lighthouselabs.ca)
 Data Science Bootcamp. These are my personal notes and are a work in progress. A lot of the code in here is messy, contains errors, and may not follow good coding practices.
